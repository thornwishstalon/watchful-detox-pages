## Install on Watch

Surprisingly, installing `Watchful` on a WearOS watch is not so much different than installing it on a phone.

### Use play store link

You will receive a ==link== that points you to `play.google.com` that lets you install the Watchful apps on your phone and watch.

!!! warning
    You will need login with your Google account

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! note
    Don't be alarmed by the `(unreviewed)` suffix. The reasons for this is, that the app has not yet been
    reviewed and approved by Google.

### to make the most of Watchful:

!!! note
    The `Watchful`-App on your phone will query fitness data from {++GoogleFit++}. This data is collected first through the
    watch. :wink:
