## Install Steps for your Phone

### Step 1: Install via `Google Play` link

You will receive a ==link== that points you to `play.google.com` that lets you install the Watchful apps on your phone and watch.

!!! warning
You will need login with your Google account

!!! note
Don't be alarmed by the `(unreviewed)` suffix. The reasons for this is, that the app has not yet been
reviewed and approved by Google.

### Step 2: Allow `Watchful` access to read usage statistics

!!! note
Since Android 10 app permissions have become stricter to the point, that special permissions need to be actively
provided to apps through you. see [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/privacy/changes) for more information.

This is done with the following steps:

- open Watchful
- goto settings
- press login button
- select your google fit account
- TODO: follow the oauth flow
